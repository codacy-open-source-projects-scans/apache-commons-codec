/**
 * Provides Base32 encoding in a streaming fashion (unlimited size). When encoding the default lineLength is 76 characters and the default lineEnding is CRLF,
 * but these can be overridden by using the appropriate constructor.
 * <p>
 * The default behavior of the Base32OutputStream is to ENCODE, whereas the default behavior of the Base32InputStream is to DECODE. But this behavior can be
 * overridden by using a different constructor.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since this class operates directly on byte streams, and not character streams, it is hard-coded to only encode/decode character encodings which are
 * compatible with the lower 127 ASCII chart (ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, UTF-8, etc).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> It is mandatory to close the stream after the last byte has been written to it, otherwise the final padding will be omitted and the
 * resulting data will be incomplete/inconsistent.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can set the decoding behavior when the input bytes contain leftover trailing bits that cannot be created by a valid encoding. These can be bits that are
 * unused from the final character or entire characters. The default mode is lenient decoding.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Lenient: Any trailing bits are composed into 8-bit bytes where possible. The remainder are discarded.
 * <li>Strict: The decoding will raise an {@link IllegalArgumentException} if trailing bits are not part of a valid encoding. Any unused bits from the final
 * character must be zero. Impossible counts of entire final characters are not allowed.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When strict decoding is enabled it is expected that the decoded bytes will be re-encoded to a byte array that matches the original, i.e. no changes occur on
 * the final character. This requires that the input bytes use the same padding and alphabet as the encoder.
 * </p>
